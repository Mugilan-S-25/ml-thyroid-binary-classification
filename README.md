# 🧠 Machine Learning-Based Thyroid Disease Classification (Binary Classification)

This project implements a machine learning model for thyroid disease Classification (Binary Classification) using Python. The notebook is designed to run on Google Colab, allowing execution without any local setup.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:

- Analyze thyroid-related medical data
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
- Train machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance
- Predict thyroid disease based on input features

The full workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — is implemented in `Thyroid-code.ipynb`.
